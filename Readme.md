# ðŸš— Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression and Streamlit

This is a machine learning project that predicts the selling price of a car based on features like mileage, engine size, power, car age, fuel type, and more. A trained Linear Regression model is used, and a user-friendly frontend is built using Streamlit.
